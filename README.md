# Report On DQ Stock Analysis


## Overview of Project

Steve just graduated with a Finance degree. His Parents are proud of him. They are also passionate about green energy and other alternative means. In fact, they are looking at investing in alternative energy that they foresee relacing fossil fuel in the future. They are interested in a company called DAQO New Energy Corp., which is one of the green energy companies. They wanted him to help them make an informed decision about investing in DAQO ($DQ).

In order to do these, Steve wanted to utilize Visual Basics for Applications (VBA), in order to automate his analysis and calculate complex logic. He has gathered data on $DQ and 11 other green energy companies that operate in the same alternative industry and are trading in the stock exchange. These data include daily trading volume, opening stock prices, high of day prices, low of day prices, closing prices and adjusted close prices (to adjust for dividends and stock splits) for 2017 and 2018.

### Results
Using VBA to write scripts such as creating a variable for stock tickers, output arrays, looping and if then statements, I ws able to list the relevant stock tickers and compute the total trading volume by year for each stock. Both the starting and ending prices were computed in order to determine the return on investments by year. Overall, total trading volume were similar for both years at over 3 billion for all 12 stocks. See included in the file the .vb file for the analysis.

### 2017
2017 was a very good year for the 12 companies. An average of 67.3% return on investment was achieved. Only $TERP had a negative return at -7.2%. The 67.3% ROI would have compared favorably to a broad market index. Coincidentally, $DQ was the best performing stock among the 12 companies at 199.4% with over 35.7 miilion traded volume. To put into context, a $1,000 investment at the begininning of 2017 would have been worth about $3,000. Steve's parent will be happy with this result and investment in $DQ would be worth while. Here's a snapshot of 2017 performance:

### 2018
2018 is the reverse of 2017. Every companies had negative returns, except for $ENPH and $RUN. An overall average return of -8.5% was achieved. The negative performance could be because of economic slowdown, lower fossil fuel prices, investors shifting investments to fossil fuel companies or other attractive opportunities, poor operational results, equity offering, etc. $DQ had a -62.6% and more than tripled its trading volume. This means $DQ only retained 37.4% of its value by the end of 2018 compared to the start of 2018. Here's a snapshot of 2018 performance:

#### Summary

The assumption is that Steve's parents are interested in $DQ for long term investment. It is not known what their risk tolerance is, but given that alternative energy companies are new, they are willing to accept some risks associated with green energy investments. To make an informed decision, it is better to look at both 2017 and 2018 combined and not in isolation. For example, an investor will want to invest in $DQ if he/she looks at the 2017 performance, but will likely pass on investing in DQ if looking at 2018 performance in isolation. Combining both years, $DQ returned 12% over 2 years, which is 6% per annum. Although investment in $DQ achieved a positive return over 2017 & 2018, it is highly volatile with 199.4% and -62.6% respectively in both years. On the information Steve has gathered and assessed, $DQ seems to be a high risk investment, and it's not determinable if investment in $DQ will continue to be viable in future years. 

In conclusion, given that Steve's parents are passionate about alternative green energy companies, it would be too risky to invest in just 1 green energy company. Steve should advise his parents to invest in a basket of green energy companies in order to reduce risk and ensure the participation of future growth in the green energy industry. For starters, $1,000 invested over both years in all 12 companies, returned 48%, or 24% per annum which compares favorably to the 6% per annum roi in $DQ.
